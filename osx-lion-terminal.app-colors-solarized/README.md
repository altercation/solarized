Solarized - OS X Terminal.app Settings for OS 10.7 Lion
=======================================================

Installation
------------

The version of Terminal for OS 10.7 Lion has built in support for redefining the ANSI colours without the need for
any complex plugins.

Just import the two enclosed Terminal colour settings files are you are done!

The previous version of this set used Tagged colours but it appears that Terminal needs Untagged colours.  If only I knew what that meant!

### Font perfection

Personally, I would recommend the use of Inconsolata font for terminal perfection.  This is a freely available font which appears in a number of forms.  The best version I have found is this one: <https://build.opensuse.org/package/files?package=inconsolata-fonts&project=home%3Athomas-schraitle> which can then be converted to TrueType or similar with an online converter like: <http://www.freefontconverter.com/>.
