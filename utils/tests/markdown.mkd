Solarized Developers
====================

## Notes and Guidelines on **Port** Development

> When developing a _port_ of the **Solarized** colorscheme that you'd like to see 
> > included in the main project repository, please consider the following 
> > guidelines:

1. No hue or __color changes__...

2. If you are making a new port, consider creating a repository with just the 
   theme/plugin for your particular port, rather than \*forking\* the entire 
   *Solarized* master repository...  
   a line break right there

* this is an example `function();`
- another list item
+ and another

1986\. What a great season.
