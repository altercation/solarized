# Solarize color theme tmux configuration

A tmux solarized theme using Ethan Schoonoverâ€™s [Solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).

## Repositories
  * This theme as a single repository: [/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized](https://github.com/seebi/tmux-colors-solarized)
  * The main solarized repository: [/altercation/solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)

## Installation
This config snippet for the terminal multiplexer tmux should be added to your `~/.tmux.conf` configuration file.

In most cases, you have to force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.
For this, start tmux as `tmux -2`.

This color scheme is tested with tmux >= 1.5. tmux 1.1 is reported as not working.

## Screenshot
Here is a screenshot of a tmux session captured from a gnome-terminal using the [dz-version of the awesome Inconsolata font](http://nodnod.net/2009/feb/12/adding-straight-single-and-double-quotes-inconsola/).
