Solarized colors for Gnome Terminal
===================================

Gnome terminal does not let you save or load color settings, so these scripts are small shell scripts to wrap several _gconftool-2_ commands.

This script overloads your Default terminal theme. Change the scripts if you want to modify another terminal theme.

Howto
-----

After checking it out, run the set_dark.sh or set_light.sh to set the palette, foreground, highlight and background colors.
