Installation
------------

### Option 1: Manual installation

1.  Copy `Solarized Dark.xml` and `Solarized Light.xml` to your PhpStorm preferences:
  - On Linux it is in  `/home/<username>/.WebIde<version>0/config/colors`.
  - On Mac it is in `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde<version>0/colors`.
  - On Windows it is in `C:\Users\<username>\.WebIde<version>0\config\colors`.
  
  Replace `WebIde<version>0` with the Version of PhpStorm you use, e.g. WebIde70 for PhpStorm 7

2. Restart PhpStorm

3. Go to `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts` and select one of the new color themes.

### Option 2: Import settings

1. Clone (or download) this repository.
2. Go to `File | Import Settings` select the directory and click `Choose`.
3. Check `Color schemes` and press `Ok`.
4. Restart PhpStorm.
5. Go to `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts` and select one of the new color themes.

Note About Fonts
-----------------
Unfortunately, font settings are included in the color settings files. It is currently set to Consolas.
You should probably modify these in `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts | Font` after adding the color schemes.
