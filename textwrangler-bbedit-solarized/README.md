Since TextWrangler (and BBEdit) don't allow you to save theme files separately, these `.bbcolor` files are generated by John Gruber's [BBColors][b] utility, which manipulates their preferences file directly.

To install these, place the files in `~/Library/Application\ Support/BBColors` and, with TextWrangler/BBEdit *closed*, invoke [BBColors][b] thusly:

For BBEdit:

<pre>./bbcolors -load "Solarized Dark"</pre>

For TextWrangler:

<pre>./bbcolors -load "Solarized Light" -tw</pre>

  [b]:http://daringfireball.net/projects/bbcolors/

When you restart your editor, the theme will have been applied.
