Solarized Colorscheme for NetBeans
==============================

Developed by Ethan Schoonover <es@ethanschoonover.com>
Ported to NetBeans by Brian Fenton [https://github.com/fentie]

See the [homepage for the Solarized colorscheme][solarized] for versions for 
Vim, popular terminal emulators and other applications.

If you have come across this colorscheme via the [NetBeans-only repository on 
github][netbeans-solarized-github], see the link above to the Solarized homepage or
visit the [github repository for Solarized][solarized-github].

Installation
------------

1. Download the zipped version of this repo.

2. Open NetBeans, select Preferences, then Import in the lower left. Navigate
   to the zip file you downloaded, check the Netbeans\_Solarized\_Dark box under
   the Fonts & Colors section. 

3. Restart NetBeans (just to be on the safe side). 

Which Variation?
----------------

Normally there would be a discussion of 16- vs. 256-color versions of Solarized
here, but I've only ported the 16-color dark version. This color scheme is also
not as flashy/rich as the Vim ones due to lack of granularity in the NetBeans
theme preferences.

The Values
----------

NetBeans uses RGB values for its colors. For the full list of colors specified in
other formats, see [the main Solarized home page][solarized]
