Solarized - Xcode 4 Color Presets
=================================

Installation
------------

I believe these themes will not work for any Xcode 3 users out there, but if you have Xcode 4 install, you should be in luck!

1. Copy the .dvtcolortheme files from this directory into ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes - you may have to make this folder if you haven't changed your color themes.

2. You're done!
