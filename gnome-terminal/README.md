Installation
------------
Copy the file %gconf.xml to your gnome-terminal profiles

    $ cp \%gconf.xml ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Profile0

Optionally, if you'd not like to overwrite your default profile, you can make
a new profile such as

	$ mkdir -p ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Profile1

and place it there.
